# Wallstreet Watchers: Analysis of Stock Market
 
​The project was to find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing. Use ML in the context of technologies learned. You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library.You must use at least two of the below:
 
 
Python Pandas
 
Python Matplotlib
 
Tableau
 
 
Host application using Heroku or a tool of your choice.

## Background

​
Welcome to our project, the Wall Street Watcher! “Wall Street” as a term can range from “big financial institutions” to the location within the United States where financial markets and companies trade publicly on exchanges throughout the United States. But mostly, it just means “money”. In our project, we sought to simplify the complex questions of “which stock” and “when to buy, sell, or hold”. While a great deal of action occurs on the trading floor of the stock market, most of the big decisions are taking place in front of a computer using highly advanced machine learning systems and general intuition to shape our global economy. In this project, we hope to enlighten users on this step in the process.

2. **Import,Visualize, and Cleanup the Data**
Systems used:
 
Python Pandas
Python Matplotlib
Tableau and Tableau Server
 
Python was used initially and included tools of pandas, web driver, and beautifulsoup. 
Tableau was utilized to visualize the data and provide analysis of the current stocks and history. A dashboard was used to reflect an overall storyboard of the dataset and initial analysis.
Scikit-learn was utilized as well as part of the initial analysis.
 
  ### Analysis
​   Stock market data was pulled from Yahoo Finance to review current stock prices as well as historical trends in the market. The data pull from StockAnalysis.com allowed for filtering this history into buckets by the industry each company serves. Using machine learning, we were able to identify those industries that proved to be the least volatile in price according to their historical data.
 
​
### Summary
 
The Wall Street Watcher dashboard allows entry level investors to review each stock ticker over time and make educated trades based on the stock’s relative volatility. By using this dashboard, users are better equipped to take strong positions on stocks over time.
